Functions Usage

instead of using printf() function for debugging,
use the below function calls to print a number, string or a newline

for newline: _put_byte('\n');
for string:  _put_str("your string here");
for number:  _put_value(your_number_here);

Examples:
        _put_value(START_POINT);
        _put_value(END_POINT);
        _put_str("Hello World!");
        _put_byte('\n');
